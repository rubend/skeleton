-----------
The easiest way to compile this code is using the inline library in R.
The steps:
    .	setwd($directory-with-source-files$)
    .	load library(inline) library(pcalg)
    .	 skeleton <- cxxfunction(signature(pt="integer",alphat="numeric",m_maxt="integer",C="numeric"),body=paste(readLines("skeletonquick.cpp"),collapse="\n"),includes=paste(readLines("graphfuncts.cpp"),collapse="\n"),plugin="RcppArmadillo")

See also the test file refTestExpl.R.

R libraries needed:
------------------
- inline
- pcalg
- Rcpp
- RcppArmadillo

NOTE:
-----
For programmers trying to understand the code and the naming of functions in the code:
this code is a c++ implementation of R code (written by Markus Kalisch) and was thus written to make it readable to the original author and people that already understood the R code.

The style of the code might be changed later on when optimizations will be done.
