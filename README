README file
-----------
This code is of a semester project supervised by Markus Kalisch at the ETH Zurich.
It's a reimplementation of the critical part of an R algorithm for causal inference in c++.
Speedups of 100x to 300x were achieved in day to day (realistic) testcases.
For smaller problem sets speedups of around 50x are achieved.

Variable, function names & buildup of the code were done to resemble the R implementation. The whole idea was that the original author of the R code would require minimal time to understand it.
This, however, might make it more difficult for 3rd parties to read it.

Run
---
The easiest (and currently only supported) way to compile & run this code is using the inline library in R.
The steps:
    .	setwd($directory-with-source-files$)
    .	load library(inline) library(pcalg)
    .	 skeleton <- cxxfunction(signature(pt="integer",alphat="numeric",m_maxt="integer",C="numeric"),body=paste(readLines("skeletonquick.cpp"),collapse="\n"),includes=paste(readLines("graphfuncts.cpp"),collapse="\n"),plugin="RcppArmadillo")

call    skeleton(p,alpha,m_max,Corrmat)

See also the test file prepareruntime.r.

Compilation outside of R:

R libraries needed:
------------------
- inline
- pcalg
- Rcpp
- RcppArmadillo

License:
--------
Open source GPL v2 for the bulk of the code.

NOTE:
-----
For programmers trying to understand the code and the naming of functions in the code:
this code is a c++ implementation of the skeleton R code and was thus written to make it readable to the original author and people that already understood the R code.

The style of the code might be changed later on when optimizations will be done.
