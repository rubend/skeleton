-----------
The easiest way to compile & run this code is using the inline library in R.
The steps:
    .	setwd($directory-with-source-files$)
    .	load library(inline) library(pcalg)
    .	 skeleton <- cxxfunction(signature(pt="integer",alphat="numeric",m_maxt="integer",C="numeric"),body=paste(readLines("skeletonquick.cpp"),collapse="\n"),includes=paste(readLines("graphfuncts.cpp"),collapse="\n"),plugin="RcppArmadillo")

call    skeleton(p,alpha,m_max,Corrmat)

See also the test file refTestExpl.R.

Compilation outside of R:
-------------------------
not supported yet, because of issues with the makefile

Test runs
---------
see the test file refTestExpl.R

R libraries needed:
------------------
- inline
- pcalg
- Rcpp
- RcppArmadillo

License:
--------
see source files. Generally GPL 2.

NOTE:
-----
For programmers trying to understand the code and the naming of functions in the code:
this code is a c++ implementation of the skeleton R code and was thus written to make it readable to the original author and people that already understood the R code.

The style of the code might be changed later on when optimizations will be done.
